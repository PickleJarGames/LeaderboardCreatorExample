# LeaderboardCreatorExample
An example of using Danqzq's leaderboard creator for my game Rush Hour at Bartholomew's

The player earns a higher score by beating the game faster, so I subtract their time from a large MAX_TIME number so the leaderboard creator sees a lower time as a higher score, then I simply reverse the calculation when I need to display player times.
